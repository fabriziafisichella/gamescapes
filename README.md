### Educational project. [ `HTML5` | `CSS` | `JAVASCRIPT`]

<br>
I created this site using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT during my third month of study.<br>
The site adapts to any device thanks to the use of flexboxes and media queries.<br>
I approached for the first time a component-based structure to familiarize with it before studying React.

> [!NOTE] 
> My skills have improved since the day I made this site.<br>
> There are mistakes I could have corrected, but I chose not to on purpose.<br>
> In this way I intend to keep a history of my progress.<br>
